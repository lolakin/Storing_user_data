                    With caution and varying degrees of pressure, Prenatal massage targets specific

                <h1 class="heading2">What is Prenatal or Prenatal Massage?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                Prenatal massage is a type of therapy that is similar to regular massage.<br>
                It is applied by a specialist to relax tense muscles, ease sore spots, enhance blood circulation and mobility, and literally makes you feel good.<br>
                But prenatal massage is especially customized to the needs of pregnant women and their changing bodies.<br>
                Here at Magic Touch, Nigeria, we have seasoned therapists who are especially trained in prenatal massage, and they know how to professionally adjust their techniques according to the needs of pregnant clients.

                <h1 class="heading2">What are the Benefits of Prenatal Massage?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    Research on the therapeutic benefits of massage for pregnant women suggest that prenatal massage may:
                </p><br>
                <ul class="service_points">
                    <li>lower stress levels and positively enhance moods</li><br>
                    <li>minimise prenatal anxiety and depression</li><br>
                    <li>lower the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight in infants of women with prenatal depression</li><br>
                    <li>minimize swelling in the legs (after massaging the feet)</li>
                </ul><br><hr><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    Getting a <strong>quality Prenatal massage</strong> has the capability to transport you to a more relaxed state of mind, which would resultantly help you to cope with all the other big changes that are happening in your life.<br>
                    If you decide to get a prenatal massage, it's vital that you inform your massage therapist the particular areas of your body that need attention.<br>
                    And do not hesitate to let her know right away if anything she does or your position causes discomfort during the massage.

                <h1 class="heading2">How Can I Find a Good Prenatal Massage Therapist in Lagos or Abuja?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    Numerous hospitals, gynaecologists and friends of pregnant women in both Lagos and Abuja always recommend us. Our massage therapists are well-trained in Prenatal massage. So, be rest assured that you'd be in safe hands, when you entrust your massage in our hands.<br>
                    Be advised that, under some circumstances, we may require clearance from your doctor or midwife before rendering Prenatal massage. So, ask us about that ahead of time, before you make your booking.<br>
                    Please, allow our Prenatal massage therapists to take care of you, once you get a massage prescription from your midwife or doctor for a medical reason like back pain.<br>
                    Whenever you're getting a massage therapy during Prenatal, do not forget to inform your therapist that you're pregnant before the session begins.

            <h1 class="heading2">How do I Lie on a Massage Table When I'm Pregnant?</h1><br>
            <p id="answ">
                Right from the onset of Pregnancy, you may feel uncomfortable whenever you lie face down, due to your tender, swollen breasts.<br>
                And it is unsafe to allow a pregnant woman to lie face down on a traditional massage table, once her belly has started to bulge.<br>
                You can safely lie on your side and use pillows, wedges, or a full-length body pillow for support.<br>
                Sometimes our pregnancy massage therapists even use a special table or pad with hollowed areas and pillows to accommodate the woman's belly and breasts, to enable her to comfortably lie face down.<br>
                If lying face down on a special prenatal massage table triggers stress of your lower back, we recommend that you try lying on your side or simply ask your therapist to help you find a comfortable position.<br>
                And don't forget that it is a bad idea to lie flat on your back, especially when you're past midpregnancy.<br>
                The reason is because the weight of your uterus exerts enormous stress on the vein that returns blood from your legs to your heart.
            </p><br>

            <h1 class="heading2">When is a Prenatal Massage Unsafe?</h1><br>
            <p id="answ">
                Having a prenatal massage may be risky in a few situations, such as if:
            </p><br>
            <ul class="service_points">
                <li>You have a blood clot or a bone fracture.</li><br>
                <li>You have a skin injury or condition that could be worsened by rubbing.<br> These include burns, open wounds, skin infections, or eczema(a medical condition in which patches of skin become rough and inflamed with blisters which cause itching and bleeding).</li><br>
                <li>You've experienced an allergic reaction to massage oils.</li>
            </ul><br><hr><br>
