                    Deep Tissue Massage therapy focuses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue. It is especially helpful for relieving chronically-tense and contracted areas like sore shoulders, low back tightness and stiff necks. Just like classic massage therapy, some of the same strokes are, but in this case, the pressure is deeper and the movement is slower with concentration on areas of pain and tension.<br>

                <h1 class="heading2">How Does Deep Tissue Massage Work?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    When you experience chronic muscle tension or injury, usually, there are adhesions (bands of painful, rigid tissue) in tendons, ligaments and muscles.
                    Such adhesions have the capability to block blood circulation and cause inflammation, limited movement and pain.<br>
                    This is where deep tissue massage comes into play by physically breaking down these adhesions to relieve pain and restore normalcy of movement.<br>
                    To achieve the desired positive result,
                    our massage therapists often use direct deep pressure or friction, applied across the grain of the muscles.
                </p><br>

                <h1 class="heading2">Does Deep Tissue Massage Hurt?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    At one point or the other during a deep tissue massage session, some clients usually experience some levels of discomfort and pain. It is important to promptly inform the massage therapist whenever you feel hurt and if any pain or soreness you experience is beyond your comfort range.<br>
                    Usually, some people experience stiffness or pain after a deep tissue massage, but it fades away within a day or so. Depending on some factors, your massage therapist may recommend applying ice to the area after the massage.

                <h1 class="heading2">The Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    Unlike some other types of massage therapy, which are mainly used for relaxation, deep tissue massage typically focuses on a specific problem. And such problems include, but are not limited to, recovery from an injury, limited mobility, chronic pain, repetitive strain injury, muscle tension or spasm, fibromyalgia, postural problem, etc.<br><br>
                    It has long been proven, as confirmed by the Consumer Reports magazine in August 2005, that deep tissue massage is ranked more effective in relieving osteoarthritis pain than prescription medications, physical exercise, physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic, diet and glucosamine. Deep tissue massage also has the top ranking for relieving fibromyalgia pain. All our clients testify of improved range of motion immediately after a deep tissue massage therapy.

                <h1 class="heading2">What Can I Expect During My Visit?</h1><br>
                <p id="answ">
                    A massage therapist may use forearms, knuckles, fingertips, hands, and elbows during a deep tissue massage session.<br>
                    As your therapist works on some tense areas, we may ask you to breathe deeply.<br>
                    Here at Magic Touch, we strongly advise our clients to drink plenty of water after a massage, in order to flush metabolic waste from the tissues.
